# DL based classifier and debiasing it
Classifier for hair color classification and gender bias removal on hair color

We will develop classifiers for hair color identification aand will also see the issues with bias introduced by dataset and hiow to overcome this. 


Things to do:

1.Use WandB for logging rather than tensorbioard
2.Train base model
3.Improve debiasing using gender
4.Streamlit App
5.Dockerize the code
